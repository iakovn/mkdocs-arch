# MkDocs Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the architectural documentation for our project. This documentation provides an overview of the system architecture, its components, and their interactions.

## Overview

This documentation is structured to give you a comprehensive understanding of the architecture, including detailed descriptions and visual representations of the system components.

## Getting Started

To get started with the documentation, you can navigate through the sections listed in the sidebar. The main sections include:

- [Architecture](architecture.md): Detailed architectural documentation.
- [Diagrams](diagrams/architecture.puml): Visual representations of the architecture using PlantUML.

Feel free to explore the documentation and reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the architecture.
